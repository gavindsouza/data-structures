## Stuff that I do to scratch an itch

Implemented a trie in Python because I've been obsessed with it since I learnt about it first a few years ago. I'll be adding more stuff that I "feel" like trying or if I have any newer, better ideas.

Been learning Rust because it's so cool. Started implementing Trie in Rust and wanted to benchmark while integrating it as a Python module :D That's a wip until I decide to get back to it.
